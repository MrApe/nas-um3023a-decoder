# nas-um3023a-decoder
Javascript decoder for NAS LoRaWANÂ®  IP68 PULSE READER + ANALOG UM3023 for Chirpstack application server.

It is currently in testing use and not meant for production environments. Also functionality is limited to the use cases I have (pulse reading). If you need more fiunctionality (like analog readings) just create a pull request.

This decoder is inspired by the [generic netvox device decoder](https://github.com/hayesey/netvox-decoder).
